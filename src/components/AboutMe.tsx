                Hi, I’m Robert Astorino a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, intuitive, and high-performing websites. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript , as well React, Node.js and others.
                I enjoy bringing ideas to life and solving complex challenges along the way.
            </p>
            <p className="py-6">
                My journey into web development started with a fascination for programming. Since then, I've evolved my skill set and honed a versatile approach to development, blending clean code, creative design and user-centric solutions.
                When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me giving kittens to the homeless, always on the lookout for inspiration and fresh perspectives. I’m excited to continue creating digital experiences that make a difference, 
                whether it’s a responsive website, an engaging app, or a fully custom project.
                Ready to collaborate or just curious about what I do? Let’s connect and build something awesome together.
